## Overview  

This project focuses on analyzing crime patterns in Los Angeles using a dataset of reported crimes from 2020 to the present. The goal is to identify crime trends, hotspots, and demographic insights, as well as forecast future crime rates.  

---

## Key Objectives  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Uncover hidden patterns and correlations in the data.  
   - Visualize geographic distributions and time-series trends.  
2. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   - Forecast future crime rates using ARIMA models.  
3. **Demographic Insights:**  
   - Analyze victim age, gender, and common crime types.

## Process  

1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   - Imported and processed a CSV dataset using Python and Pandas.  

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns.  
   - Resolved duplicates and standardized data types.  

3. **EDA Highlights:**  
   - Identified seasonal crime patterns and most frequent crime types.  
   - Mapped regional crime rates to highlight hotspots.  

4. **Advanced Analysis:**  
   - Predicted future trends with ARIMA models.  
   - Evaluated COVID-19's impact on crime rates.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels  
- **Techniques:** Time-series forecasting, correlation analysis, and geospatial mapping.

## Key Findings  
- Central LA, 77th Street, and Pacific areas reported the highest crime rates.  
- Vehicle thefts emerged as the most common crime type.  
- Seasonal trends indicated higher crime rates at the start of the year.  
- ARIMA model predictions suggest a declining crime rate trend for 2024–2025.
